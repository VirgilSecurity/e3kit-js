# Virgil E3Kit SDK for Browsers
Sample project demonstrating the usage of `@virgilsecurity/e3kit-browser` UMD build.

## Get Started
1. Configure and start the server in the `examples/backend` folder following instructions in `../examples/backend/README.md`.
2. Install dependencies with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).
  ```sh
  yarn install
  ```
  > You need to use Yarn because we use [Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) in this repository :)
3. Make sure that `API_URL` value in `src/index.html` is correct.
4. Run the following command to start the demo(it simply serves the `src` folder)
