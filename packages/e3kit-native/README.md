# Virgil E3Kit SDK for React Native

## Installation

This module is available on NPM as `@virgilsecurity/e3kit-native`.

```sh
npm install @virgilsecurity/e3kit
```

There are several dependencies that are required for correct E3kit functioning in React Native but aren't bundled in the package as dependencies.
You'll need to install these dependencies yourself:

* [@react-native-community/async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage) - Used as storage backend for group chats. Optional. React Native's [own AsyncStorage](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/asyncstorage) can also be used.
* [@virgilsecurity/key-storage-rn](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-key-storage-rn) - Used as storage for private keys
* [react-native-keychain](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-keychain) - Storage backend for `@virgilsecurity/key-storage-rn`
* [react-native-virgil-crypto](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/react-native-virgil-crypto) - Native Crypto Library bridge.

```sh
npm install @react-native-community/async-storage @virgilsecurity/key-storage-rn react-native-keychain react-native-virgil-crypto
```

## Usage

You need to pass your `AsyncStorage` implementation in

```js
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-community/async-storage';
import { EThree } from '@virgilsecurity/e3kit-native';

EThree.initialize(getTokenCallback, { AsyncStorage })
.then(eThree => {
    // register user, encrypt, decrypt, etc.
})
```
